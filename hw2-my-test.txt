<s> as i ponder'd in silence </s>
<s> returning upon my poems considering lingering long </s>
<s> a phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect </s>
<s> terrible in beauty age and power </s>
<s> the genius of poets of old lands </s>
<s> as to me directing like flame its eyes </s>
<s> with finger pointing to many immortal songs </s>
<s> and menacing voice what singest thou it said </s>
<s> know'st thou not there is hut one theme for ever enduring bards </s>
<s> and that is the theme of war the fortune of battles </s>
<s> the making of perfect soldiers </s>
<s> be it so then i answer'd </s>
<s> i too haughty shade also sing war and a longer and greater one than any </s>
<s> waged in my book with varying fortune with flight advance </s>
<s> and retreat victory deferr'd and wavering </s>
<s> yet methinks certain or as good as certain at the last the field the world </s>
<s> for life and death for the body and for the eternal soul </s>
<s> lo i too am come chanting the chant of battles </s>
<s> i above all promote brave soldiers </s>
<s> in cabin'd ships at sea </s>
<s> the boundless blue on every side expanding </s>
<s> with whistling winds and music of the waves </s>
<s> the large imperious waves </s>
<s> or some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine </s>
<s> where joyous full of faith spreading white sails </s>
<s> she cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day </s>
<s> or under many a star at night </s>
<s> by sailors young and old haply will i a reminiscence of the land be read </s>
<s> in full rapport at last </s>
<s> here are our thoughts voyagers' thoughts </s>
<s> here not the land firm land alone appears may then by them be said </s>
<s> the sky o'erarches here </s>
<s> we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet </s>
<s> we feel the long pulsation ebb and flow of endless motion </s>
<s> the tones of unseen mystery </s>
<s> the vague and vast suggestions of the briny world </s>
<s> the liquid-flowing syllables </s>
<s> the perfume the faint creaking of the cordage the melancholy rhythm </s>
<s> the boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here </s>
<s> and this is ocean's poem </s>
<s> exalte rapt ecstatic </s>
<s> the visible but their womb of birth </s>
<s> of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape </s>
<s> the mighty earth eidolon </s>
<s> all space all time </s>
<s> the stars the terrible perturbations of the suns </s>
<s> swelling collapsing ending serving their longer shorter use </s> 
<s> fill'd with eidolons only </s>
<s> the noiseless myriads </s>
<s> the infinite oceans where the rivers empty </s>
<s> the separate countless free identities like eyesight </s>
<s> the true realities eidolons </s>
<s> not this the world </s>

<s> eidolons eidolons </s>
<s> beyond thy lectures learn'd professor </s>
<s> beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen beyond all mathematics </s>
<s> beyond the doctor's surgery anatomy </s>
<s> beyond the chemist with his chemistry </s>
<s> the entities of entities, eidolons </s>
<s> unfix'd yet fix'd </s>
<s> ever shall be ever have been and are </s>
<s> sweeping the present to the infinite future </s>
<s> eidolons eidolons eidolons </s>

<s> how there is something relentless in their fate all times </s>
<s> how all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward </s>

<s> on journeys through the states we start </s>

<s> sailing henceforth to every land </s>
<s> to every sea </s>
<s> we willing learners of all </s> 
<s> teachers of all </s>
<s> and lovers of all </s>
<s> we have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on </s>
<s> and have said why should not a man or woman do as much as the seasons </s>
<s> and effuse as much </s>
<s> we dwell a while in every city and town </s>
<s> we pass through canada the north east </s>
<s> the vast valley of the mississippi </s>
<s> and the southern states </s>
<s> we confer on equal terms with each of the states </s>
<s> we make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear </s>
<s> we say to ourselves remember fear not be candid promulge the body and the soul </s>
<s> dwell a while and pass on be copious temperate chaste magnetic </s>
<s> and what you effuse may then return as the seasons return </s>
<s> and may be just as much as the seasons </s>
